Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Projects
===========================================
This repo contains my work on Udacity's [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) Projects.

# Planning Search

For this project, we implement a planning search agent to solve deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system. We use a **planning graph** and **automatic domain-independent heuristics with A* search** and compare their results/performance against several **uninformed non-heuristic search methods** (breadth-first, depth-first, etc.).

Additional details can be found [here](./AIND-Planning/README.md).

# Simulated_Annealing

simulated annealing is a probablistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem--one of the simplest "gradient-free" optimization techniques. In this exercise you will check your understanding by implementing simulated annealing to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.  Briefly, the TSP is an optimization problem that seeks to find the shortest path passing through every city exactly once.  In our example the TSP path is defined to start and end in the same city (so the path is a closed loop).
Additional details can be found [here](./AIND-Planning/README.md).

# Game-Playing Agent

This game-playing agent uses techniques such as **iterative deepening**, **Minimax**, and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to beat its opponent in a game of *Isolation* (a two-ply discrete competitive game with perfect information).
For details about my implementation, please visit this [link](./AIND-Isolation/README.md).

# Diagonal Sudoku Solver

In this introductory project, we use **constraint propagation** to find solutions to Sudoku puzzles, repeatedly applying game rules (constraints) until the Sudoku puzzle stops changing.
