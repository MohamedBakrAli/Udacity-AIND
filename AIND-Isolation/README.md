# Game Playing Agent Using Adversarial Search

![Example game of isolation](viz.gif)

In this project, I develop adversarial search agent to play the Isolation game. Beside of helper class provide by Udacity, for example, Isolation game rules, Isolation Board setup, I implement following techniques in game_agent.py to develop an agent:

MinimaxPlayer.minimax(): implement minimax search
AlphaBetaPlayer.alphabeta(): implement minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
AlphaBetaPlayer.get_move(): implement iterative deepening search
custom_score(), custom_score_2(), custom_score_3(): implement my own alternate position evaluation heuristic
Moreover, I also provide 2 analysis reports including:

Heuristic Analysis: detail analysis of evaluation heuristics I have implemented in cutom_score(), cutom_score2(), and cutom_score3().
